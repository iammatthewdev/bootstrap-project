          <p>I live Kirkland, Washington with the most amazing wife and we have two dogs Charlie and Eleven (named after El
            from Strangers Things).</p>

          <p>Offen time you’ll find me eating Pizza. My favorite pizza place is Five50 Pizza Bar located at the Aria Resort
            and Casino in fabulous Las Vegas. My second favorite pizza place is The Crown which is located in Downtown
            Portland.</p>

          <p>I’m a huge Star Wars fan. My favorite character from the show is Yodi. My favorite episodes are two and three
            since you get to see that little green dude fight.</p>

          <p>Apple takes all my money each year. My daily diver is my iPhone 12 Pro and I use a OnePlus 8t as a secondary
            device.</p>

          <p>I like to take pictures and living in the PSW make for some incredible views. Check out more of my photos on my
            Instagram page.</p>

          <p>I use to talk on the radio. As a young boy, I always knew that I wanted to be on the radio. When I was a little
            kid you would often find me in the neighborhood playing music with my karaoke machine even talking over songs
            intros and playing radio jingles. I officially started my radio career at a small community radio start in
            Lynnwood, KSER-FM 90.7. While at KSER, I hosted several different shows. In addition, I produced several
            different shows including the Everett Aquasox Broadcast. I started my first paying job at KRKO Radio 1380 AM in
            Everett, WA. I also designed and developed the station’s website. During my time there, I also worked on
            engineering projects including preparing the station for “Y2K.”</p>

          <p>After graduating High School, I found a home at the University of Washington’s KUOW 94.9 FM as an Operation
            Assistant. While I loved working behind the scenes, I knew that I wanted to move toward being on the radio
            again. I would later find myself working on 92.5 KLSY as Board Operator and Producer of a nationally syndicated
            show produced in Seattle. After the station rebranded, I found a home in the morning drive time producing
            Murdock, Hunter, & Alice. During my time at KLSY, I produced the Make-A-Wish Radio-Thon which benefited the
            local Make-A-Wish foundation When the station changed, I departed and found a new home at 96.5 Jack-FM working
            on the Jack Street Team. I represented the station at concerts, movie previews, and on the side of the freeway.
          </p>

          <p>I soon left the radio industry, as I wanted to stay in the Northwest. It was becoming harder and harder to find
            a job with so many stations under budget cuts and with several stations voice tracking.</p>

          <p>I switched careers and spent 10+ years in the Loss Prevention field. While I was working Loss Prevention field
            I leared to develop and write code from Team Treehouse, freeCodeCamp and I recently started nucamp coding
            bootcamp.</p>
